                            Some facts about Aggron by the pokedex:
                        </span> 
                        <br>
                        <b>Ruby:</b> AGGRON claims an entire mountain as its own territory. It mercilessly beats up anything that violates its environment. This POKéMON vigilantly patrols its territory at all times.
                        <br>
                        <b>Sapphire:</b> AGGRON is surprisingly protective of its environment. If its mountain is ravaged by a landslide or a fire, this POKéMON will haul topsoil to the area, plant trees, and beautifully restore its own territory.
                        <br>
                        <b>Emerald:</b> Its iron horns grow longer a little at a time. They are used to determine the AGGRON’s age. The gouges in its armor are worn with pride as mementos from battles.
